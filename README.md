Intelligent Systems The Evolution of Trust Game AI
--------------------------------------------------

First homework for Intelligent Systems course, where the task was to contruct a bot that will beat all other bots in most situations.
The types of agents (bots) that are built-in within the game, the point matrix that is used to calculate score and scenarios (.txt files) which contain game details - number of rounds, number and types of agents, game type (elimination or otherwise) are in the documentation (in serbian). 
The homework is written in Java, as a class which extends the Player class that is implemented in the library which contains implementation of the game system aswell. 
Implemented bot beats all other agents in every public Scenario dominantly, while still having a competitive edge when playing versus another bot of the same kind.


In order to run the project, extract the Homework.zip into a folder, import it into a Java IDE such as Eclipse, compile it into a JAR file.
Then extract run.zip and copy the jar file inside and open run.bat in Command Prompt which will run tests for each of the given scenarios.
